# dourgaur

Just a simple test program for me getting re-acquainted with CLion and CMake and taking a closer look at libgcrypt. 

The program doesn't do anything interesting at this point, it is just an example of tool configuration.

There was some example code for libgcrypt in the docs so I built a little program around it. I like C but don't get to use it much professionally anymore.

The name 'dourgaur' doesn't have a hidden meaning, it is just a label that's easier to pronounce than a GUID.
