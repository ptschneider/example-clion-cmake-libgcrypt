# dourgaur

Just a simple test program for me getting re-acquainted with CLion and CMake and taking a closer look at libgcrypt. 

I've enjoyed working with Node.js over the past few years, and am now interested in building custom add-ons in C.

Examples of C add-ons are provided with Node.js documentation. 

The program doesn't do anything interesting at this point, it is just an example of tool configuration.

There was some example code for libgcrypt in the docs so I built a little program around it.

The name 'dourgaur' doesn't have a hidden meaning, it is just a label that's easier to pronounce than a GUID.
